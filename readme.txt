Display how you're feeling today via a Retro Video Game Life Meter. Just input how much you want it filled and write a caption to say why.

== Description ==

The plugin comes with a widget which offers a title, health level 
(1-100) 
and caption option. It all so includes a short code so you can include it in your posts
or pages.
A great plugin for reviewin video games, comics, movies or anything 
really. Use the shortcode in a review post to give the subject a rating 
out of 5stars. 

== Installation ==


1. Upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `Life Meter` widget in your widget area and give it a title, health level (1-100) and caption
4. Alternately you can use the short code [ life_meter life="" ] (no spaces before or after [ ] ) in your post or page.
5. Want more hearts? Now you can have as many as you wish, in the widget there is a new option for how many hearts you want and in the short code use 
hearts = "5" (or any number you wish). 
 
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I add a title or caption in the short code? =

Since you are using the short code in your post/page I'll let you design that however you wish. If you want it though let me know and I'll add it to the 
next version.

= I want more hearts! =

Originally I built this to use 5 hearts only but I was bored today so now you can have as many as you wish! Just enter the number in the widget or in 
the shortcode as 'hearts' = '3' and the plugin will take care of the rest. *note: I haven't tested the ins and outs of this so I'm not sure how well 
it works but I don't forsee any major issues.
